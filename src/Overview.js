        <h3>A co-Founder of one of the biggest communities</h3>
        <p>
          The combined experience I have working at the top fortune 500
          companies has showed me to developer a skillset that helps me in not
          just development, but in every aspect of any business
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm proud to announce that I am now working at one of the world's
          largest communities teaching young minds about how to sell yourself as
          a developer and open them to a new world of oppurtunities
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="sidetwo">
        <p>
          As a developer, you have everything available to you and all that's
          holding you back is yourself
        </p>
        <p>I quote I live by perfectly illustrates what I mean</p>
        <p>
          "How big would you dream, if you knew you wouldn't fail?" You've
          already gone through the hardest parts being develope. It's time to
          elevate your skills and become a leader in something you're passionate
          about.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm happy to chat over coffee some time about how I can help your
          company
        </p>
